            <p class="text_1">    Great Britain is an unusual country, in some <br>
              ways very surprising and strange for residents of <br>
              many other countries, ranging from right-hand <br>
              traffic and ending with separate taps with hot <br>
              and cold water. The monetary system is also <br>
              unusual in the UK, which, however, as a result of <br>
              the 1971 transition to the decimal form, has <br>
              become much simpler and clearer.<br>
              Pounds sterling, sovereigns, guineas, crowns,<br>
              shillings, pennies, farthings. All this is English<br>
              money of different times – and this is only a part <br>
              of the denominations of the British currency! So <br>
              many varieties, such a multi-stage and complex<br>
              system!<br></p>
          </div>
          <h2 class="title_coin">Coins</h2>
          <p class="text_2_a">The concepts of "sterling" and "pound sterling" came into use in England in the Middle Ages. <br>
            240 small coins of a certain weight were minted from 1 pound of silver – pennies<br>
            (or, as such coins were also called, sterling), which until the XIII century were the most common money in <br>
            England. In fact, the very concept of "pound sterling" was originally only a counting monetary<br>
            unit and literally meant the weight measure "pound" in silver coins.</p>
          <p class="text_2_b">Over time, the denominations became more and more diverse. Shillings appeared, each of<br>
            which was equal to 12 pennies or 48 farthings. The pound, respectively, was equal to 20 <br>
            shillings. Shillings, nicknamed "Bob" in England, were minted en masse until 1966 inclusive.<br>
            The exception was 750,000 coins with the date "1970", prepared for the "farewell" set of old-<br>
            -style coins.</p>
          <p class="text_2_b">Pennies (or pennies) are still minted in the UK</p>
          <p class="text_2_b">A farthing is a small change coin, literally translated as a quarter. For the first time such coins<br>
            in the ¼ penny in England appeared in the XIII century. Up to and including the XVI century <br>
            and for some time in the XIX century, farthings were minted from silver, the rest of the time – <br>
            from copper and bronze. The minting of coins of this denomination was discontinued in 1956.</p>
          <p class="text_2_b">For the first time, a large coin equal to 240 pennies or 20 shillings was minted in the XV<br>
            century during the reign of Henry the Seventh and was called a sovereign. The coinage of such <br>
            a coin was made of gold.<br>
            In the XVI century, under the English Queen Elizabeth the First, a coin of 20 silver shillings <br>
            began to be called a "pound" (in English, "pound"), and coins of 30 shillings, i.e. one and a half <br>
            pounds sterling, began to be called a sovereign.<br>
            The next king of England after Elizabeth, James the First, briefly returned the 20-shilling coin<br>
            to its former name, but during his reign this coin changed its name twice more: first to united, then to laurel.<br>
            Under Charles the Second, in 1663, the guinea became the main coin of Britain – a gold coin <br>
            equated to 21 shillings, and thus amounting to 1.05 pounds sterling.</p>
          <p class="text_2_b"> In 1694, the first paper banknotes were issued in Britain. The denominations of the <br>
            banknotes were indicated in pounds sterling and were large – from 20 to 1000. Banknotes of <br>
            smaller denominations began to appear only in the second half of the XVIII century – 10 <br>
            pounds in 1759, 5 pounds in 1793, banknotes of 1 and 2 pounds in 1797.<br>
            At the beginning of the XIX century, when a single gold standard was established in Great<br>
            Britain, the sovereign, equated in value to the pound sterling, became the main major coin again.</p>
          <p class="text_2_b"> The coinage of the sovereign as a coin in circulation continued until the eighties of the XX<br>
            century. Nowadays, the sovereign is issued only as collectible and investment coins. <br>
            The crown is originally a gold coin. Its release was started in the XVI century under King Henry <br>
            the Eighth. In the first year of its appearance, it was initially equal to 4 shillings and 6 pennies,<br>
            then 5 shillings. In different periods, the crown was minted from gold and silver. Starting from<br>
            the reign of George the Sixth, crowns began to be minted from a copper-nickel alloy.</p>

          <h3 class="banknotes">Banknotes</h3>
          <p class="banknotes_text">    In 1971, the United Kingdom made the transition to the decimal system, as a result of which <br>
            the pound was equated to 100 pence. The following year, 1972, the British government gave <br>
            the British pound the opportunity to be valued using a "floating rate", which was not <br>
            supported by the Bank of England. Thus, the exchange rate of the national currency was<br>
            determined on the basis of trading on the international currency market. The result of this in <br>
            1977 was a record low exchange rate of the main monetary unit of Great Britain – $ 1.72 per<br>
            pound sterling. For comparison: back in the 40s, they gave more than $ 4 per pound, and in <br>
            the 60s up to 2.8. Today, however, the cost difference in the national currencies of the UK and<br>
            the USA is even smaller: in 2020, they give about $ 1.3 per pound.<br>
            To date, banknotes of 5, 10, 20 and 50 pounds are in circulation in the UK. Now in this country <br>
            they issue banknotes of the "G" series - this line of bills has been in circulation since 2007.</p>
          <div class="line_2"> <p>    Recently updated and put into <br>
            circulation instead of the previous <br>
            ones in 2016, the 5 pound banknotes <br>
            are made of polymer material and <br>
            have a size of 125 * 65 mm. On the <br>
            obverse, as on all banknotes of Great <br>
            Britain, there is a portrait of Queen <br>
            Elizabeth II, on the reverse – the <br>
            legendary English politician Winston <br>
            Churchill.  </p> <img alt="@" src="../Img/UK/Banknotes/2.webp" class="img_2">  </div>
          <div class="line_2"> <p>A new "ten" made of polymer <br>
            material appeared in the purses of<br>
            Her Majesty's subjects in 2017. On the<br>
            reverse of the banknote there is a<br>
            portrait of the famous English writer<br>
            Jane Austen. This banknote has a size<br>
            of 132*69 mm.  </p> <img alt="@" src="../Img/UK/Banknotes/3.webp" class="img_2">  </div>
          <div class="line_2"> <p>The 20-pound banknote is in<br>
            circulation in two forms. The first is<br>
            a paper one, which entered <br>
            circulation in 2007, with the image <br>
            of the Scottish economist and <br>
            philosopher Adam Smith on the <br>
            reverse (size 149 *80 mm). </p> <img alt="@" src="../Img/UK/Banknotes/4.webp" class="img_2">  </div>
          <div class="line_2"> The second type is a polymer <br>

            with the image of the British <br>

          <div class="line_2"> <p>In addition to these banknotes, the <br>
            circulation of the modern monetary <br>
            system of Great Britain includes <br>
            paper banknotes with a face value of<br>
            50 pounds, which entered circulation <br>
            in 2011. On the reverse side of these <br>
            banknotes are portraits of Matthew <br>
            Bolton and James Watt – the <br>
            "engines of progress" of the late XVIII <br>
            century, industrialist and engineer<br>
            who worked in tandem. This <br>
            banknote has a size of 156*85 mm. </p> <img alt="@" src="../Img/UK/Banknotes/6.webp" class="img_2">   </div>
          <p class="text_3">    In addition to the money issued by Great Britain, there are
            coins and banknotes that are issued by overseas territories - autonomies that are under the sovereignty of the United <br>
            Kingdom, but are not part of it. There are currently 14 such territories in the UK. Coins of some <br>
            of them are also in circulation in the British Isles. Also, banknotes denominated in pounds <br>
            sterling are issued by three banks of Scotland (have full circulation only there), the Bank of <br>
            England (have circulation in England and Wales) and four Northern Irish banks (are settlement <br>
            marks of Northern Ireland). These regional issues, although they are not full-fledged money,<br>
            but represent something like a bill of exchange, can be accepted throughout the United <br>
            Kingdom.</p>
